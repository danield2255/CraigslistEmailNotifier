# CraigslistEmailNotifier
A program to scrape the contents of a list of craigslist search results (currently set to look in just the 'gigs' subgroup) for a particular search term and email an input address with links to new listings each week. The user will need to provide credentials to log into a valid email and then a target address to send to. 

Any user of this repo should input: 
- A search term
- A 'from' email
- A 'from' email password
- An email to send to
- Content to put in an email


The current configurations have the program ready to send from a gmail address, but from a different email host, a parameter will need to be altered.
